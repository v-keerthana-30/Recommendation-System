# Recommendation-System
This project focuses on building a content-based recommendation system for anime using cosine similarity.

The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing: Load the anime dataset, handle missing values, and explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.

Feature Extraction: Select relevant features (e.g., genres, user ratings), convert categorical features to numerical representations, and normalize numerical data if needed.

Recommendation System: Implement a function to recommend anime based on cosine similarity, experimenting with thresholds to adjust the recommendation list.

Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, and evaluate performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

Insights: Analyze results to understand similar anime patterns and identify ways to improve recommendations.
